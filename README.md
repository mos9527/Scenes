Scenes
===
Collection of various public domain 3D scenes and models in glTF 2.0 format, packed with [gltfpack](https://meshoptimizer.org/gltf/).

A loader capable of decoding `EXT_meshopt_compression` is required. To decode them before hand, you
can use `gltfpack` without `-cc` option to produce glTF files w/o compression.
